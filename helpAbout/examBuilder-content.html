  <h2>🛠️ Exam Builder</h2>

    <h3>📐 Architecture Overview</h3>
    <p>
      The Exam Builder converts a structured Google Spreadsheet into a ZIP archive containing
      CSV files used by the APL‑ES exam engine. It supports multiple build modes (FULL, STUDENT,
      STUDENT+Learning) and integrates directly with the APL‑ES runtime.
      </p>
      <p>In other words, the Exam Builder is responsible for converting a structured Google Spreadsheet into a
    complete APL‑ES exam package. It validates the input, extracts the three required forms,
    applies column‑level transformations, and produces a standardized ZIP bundle ready for
    import into the APL‑ES runtime.
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin-top:25px;">Architecture Overview</h3> <p>The Exam Builder follows a simple, transparent processing pipeline:</p> <ol>
      <li><strong>Fetch Spreadsheet</strong> – The tool retrieves three named sheets from a Google Spreadsheet using fixed ranges.</li>
      <li><strong>Normalize Data</strong> – Columns are cleaned, blanked (where required), and validated.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Transform to CSV</strong> – Each sheet is converted into a CSV representation.</li>
      <li><strong>Package</strong> – All CSV files are bundled into a ZIP archive.</li>
      <li><strong>Load / Reload</strong> – The ZIP can be imported directly into APL‑ES to refresh the exam content.</li> </ol>

    <div style="margin:20px 0; padding:15px; background:#eef3ff; border-left:4px solid #1a73e8;"> <strong>Note:</strong> The Exam Builder supports both FULL and STUDENT versions of the exam, with optional inclusion of Learning Notes. </div>

    <h3>📊 Spreadsheet Format</h3>
    <p>The Google Spreadsheet must contain <strong>three forms</strong>, each with a specific structure.
      These forms define the questions, section/part hierarchy, and exam metadata.
      </p>

    <h2><code>examQuestions</code></h2>
     <p>This sheet defines every question in the exam. Required columns:</p>

  <pre style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:12px; border:1px solid #ccc; white-space:pre;">
ID (Question #)
Section
Part
Question
Option 1
Option 2
Option 3
Option 4
Correct (a/b/c/d)
Explain (rationale)
  </pre>

  <p>
    Each row represents a single multiple‑choice question. The <em>Correct</em> column uses
    letter‑based indexing (a–d). The <em>Explain</em> column provides the rationale shown after
    answering.  The <em>Header Row</em> is required for each sheet.  Exmples have been included for each sheet.  In the examQuestions example, newlines have been added for readability only.
  </p>
  
    <pre style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:12px; border:1px solid #ccc; white-space:pre;">
   "ID: Question number","Section","Part","Question","Option 1","Option 2","Option 3","Option 4","Correct","Explain"
   "1","1","1","What key type is recommended for Push-to-Talk (PTT) to avoid auto-repeat issues?","Space bar",
        "Enter key","Left or Right Control","Any letter key","c","Ctrl keys don’t auto-repeat like character keys,
        avoiding unwanted transmissions."
   "2","1","1","Where should your microphone be positioned for best audio quality?","Directly in front of mouth",
        "Slightly to one side and below mouth","Above the head","Against the throat","b",
        "Offset reduces breath noise and plosives while keeping clear audio."

    </pre>

    <h2><code>sectionPartTitles</code></h2>

    <p>This sheet defines the hierarchical structure of the exam:</p>

  <pre style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:12px; border:1px solid #ccc; white-space:pre;">
Section Number
Part Number
Section Name
Part Name
  </pre>

  <p>
    Sections group major topics; Parts subdivide them. The Exam Builder uses this sheet to
    generate navigation, grouping, and scoring logic.
  </p>
  
    <pre style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:12px; border:1px solid #ccc; white-space:pre;">
      "Section Number","Part Number","Section Name","Part Name"

      "1","2","BASIC PROCEDURES AND EQUIPMENT","Callsign Procedures"
      "1","3","BASIC PROCEDURES AND EQUIPMENT","Standard Phraseology - Roger and Wilco"
    </pre>

    <h2><code>examData</code></h2>

     <p>This sheet contains metadata and configuration values:</p>

  <pre style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:12px; border:1px solid #ccc; white-space:pre;">

    <h3>📦 Output</h3>
    <p>
      The builder produces a ZIP archive containing three CSV files. These files populate the
      APL‑ES exam interface, scoring engine, and navigation structure. Column blanking rules are
      applied depending on the selected build mode.
    </p>
