<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>🚀 What is APL‑ES?</h3>
<p>
APL‑ES (Adaptive Practice & Learning – Exam System) is a structured learning and exam platform.
It combines guided study with a 300‑question exam organized into 6 sections and 30 parts, designed
to help you learn, practice, and test your knowledge in a focused, repeatable way.
</p>

<h3>👤 For Students: First Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Open the APL‑ES exam page in your browser.</li>
  <li>Log in with the username, maybe by your instructor (if required). Default is "student1" </li>
  <li>Review the <strong>User Guide</strong> tab to understand navigation, buttons, and grading.</li>
  <li>Start with <strong>Section 1, Part 1</strong> and work through 5 questions at a time.</li>
  <li>Use <span class="button-example">📑 Quick Navigation</span> to jump between sections and parts as needed.</li>
</ol>

<div class="callout">
  <h4>💡 Tip</h4>
  <p>
    Treat each part (5 questions) as a mini‑lesson. Focus on understanding the explanations,
    not just getting the right answer.  "Learning Notes" may be enabled to help you through each section.
  </p>

</div>

<h3>📊 Grading and Review</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Students can use <span class="button-example">✓ Check</span> and <span class="button-example">📊 Grade Exam</span> (if enabled) to review performance.</li>

<h3>📚 Using APL‑ES as a Study Tool</h3>
<p>
APL‑ES can be used as a self‑guided study program. Work through sections in order, revisit weak
areas, and use explanations (where available) to deepen understanding. The structured format—
6 sections, 10 parts per section, 5 questions per part—helps reinforce memory and build confidence
over time.
