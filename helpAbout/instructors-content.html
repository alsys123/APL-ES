<h2>Instructor Guide</h2>

<h3>🛠️ Building Exams for Students</h3>
<p>
Instructors can generate two types of student-facing exams using the Exam Builder:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Student‑Only Exam</strong> – Answers are hidden, grading tools are disabled.</li>
  <li><strong>Student‑Only + Learning Notes</strong> – Answers remain hidden, but students can view explanatory notes after answering.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These modes ensure students can study and practice without having access to the full answer key. 
The “Full” version of the exam is reserved for instructors, grading or self-study.
</p>

<h3>🎲 Randomized Answer Options</h3>
<p>
Every time a student begins a new session, the answer options for each question are automatically scrambled. 
This means:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each student sees a unique ordering of answer choices</li>
  <li>Two students taking the same exam will not have identical option layouts</li>
  <li>Exported progress files are <strong>unique per student</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
This randomization helps reduce answer‑sharing and encourages genuine understanding.
</p>

<h3>📦 Student Export Files</h3>
<p>
When a student exports their progress, the resulting ZIP file contains:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Their unique option order</strong> for every question</li>
  <li><strong>Their selected answers</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The number of attempts</strong> they made on each question</li>
  <li><strong>Section-by-section progress</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
Because each student’s exam is randomized, every export file is different—even if two students answer the same questions correctly.
</p>

<h3>🚫 Hidden Tools in Student‑Only Mode</h3>
<p>
In Student‑Only exams, certain tools are intentionally disabled:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Toggle Answer</strong> – Hidden, since answers are not available</li>
  <li><strong>Grade Exam</strong> – Disabled or non-functional</li>
  <li><strong>Auto‑Check</strong> – Not available unless using the Learning Notes version</li>
</ul>

<p>
This ensures students cannot reveal the correct answers directly from the interface.
</p>

<h3>🧪 Grading a Student’s Exam</h3>
<p>
To grade a student’s work:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the <strong>Full</strong> version of the exam (instructor mode)</li>
  <li>Click <span class="button-example">⬆ Import</span></li>
  <li>Select the student’s exported ZIP file</li>
  <li>The system will reconstruct the student’s randomized exam</li>
  <li>Click <span class="button-example">📊 Grade Exam</span> to view results</li>
</ol>

<p>
The instructor version contains the full answer key, allowing accurate grading even when the student’s options were scrambled.
</p>

<h3>🤖 Future AI‑Generated Exams</h3>
<p>
The APL‑ES structure is designed to support future AI‑assisted exam creation. 
Emerging systems such as ChatGPT, Grok, and Copilot may eventually be able to generate:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Complete exam question banks</li>
  <li>Learning notes and explanations</li>
  <li>Section and part structures</li>
  <li>Adaptive difficulty paths</li>
</ul>

<p>
Because APL‑ES uses a consistent format—<strong>300 questions</strong> across <strong>6 sections</strong> and <strong>30 parts</strong>—it provides a strong framework for AI‑generated learning systems.
</p>

<h3>📚 A Structured Learning System</h3>
<p>
The APL‑ES exam format is intentionally designed to reinforce memory and understanding:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>6 Sections provide broad topic coverage</li>
  <li>10 Parts per section break content into manageable chunks</li>
  <li>5 Questions per part encourage focused learning</li>
</ul>

<p>
This structure supports both instructor‑led training and <strong>self‑guided study</strong>, making APL‑ES a flexible platform for aviation education and beyond.
