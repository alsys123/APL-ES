The APL-ES was interestingly named as a Learning and Exam System. It came out of a personal need to learn the contents of a 65 page document called “The C I X PRACTICAL INTRODUCTION TO RADIO PROCEDURE For VATSIM VFR PILOTS“.

After reading the document, I wanted to know if I really had learned what all the content was factually and in meaning.

It occurred to me that I could feed the document into one of the current AI systems like Grok, ChapGPT, Gemini or Copilot and produce a set of questions for me.  After many interactions and talking to the author of the document, who was a retired teacher, the questions started to take shape and the structure and organization of the test became more real.  

Working on my own and with Copilot, the system came to be.  I had other areas of interest so I included a few of those like playing Bridge.  At the same time a friend of mine was hospitalized and took a cognitive test that he failed and subsequently lost his driver’s license.  But the failure was more to do with the fact that he had no practice with tests and has just lay around in a hospital for weeks doing basically nothing, mentally.  To spring the test on someone in the position was actually, let say, unrealistic.  So I created a Cognitive test for him to practice with.  

Now we had a number of tests, so the system could be generalised as a universal learning and testing system.

The AP part of APLE-ES originally stood for “A Priori”.  Later on it came to stand for A Practical, Al’s Program, A Progressive and a few more. The L-ES always stands for Learning and Exam System.

All freeware.  The source is on GitHub.  None of the tests are official. Enjoy!
